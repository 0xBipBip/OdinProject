    <!-- The id attribute must be unique within the HTML document. To resolve this, you 
        should assign different id values to each button. -->

    <button id="btn3" onclick="alertFunction()">CLICK ME BABY</button>
    <button id="btn4" onclick="alertFunction()">CLICK MEEE</button>
    <!-- The alert function is popping up twice because you have defined two separate ways to execute 
        the alertFunction when the button is clicked.
        In your HTML code, you have an onclick attribute assigned to the button, which triggers the 
        alertFunction when the button is clicked:
        Additionally, in your JavaScript code, you are attaching an event listener to the btn4 button, 
        which also executes the alertFunction when the button is clicked:
        As a result, when you click the button, both the onclick attribute and the event listener 
        execute the alertFunction, causing the alert to appear twice.-->
